## Integration with Your Python Scripts

Your Python scraping and LLM scripts should output data in these CSV formats. The dashboard will automatically read and display the latest data.

To integrate:
1. Modify your Python scripts to save data in these CSV formats
2. Place the CSV files in this `data/` directory
3. The dashboard will automatically pick up changes and display them

## Local Development

When developing locally, you can create sample CSV files in this directory to test the dashboard functionality.
